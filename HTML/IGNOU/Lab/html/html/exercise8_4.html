    <h1>BLOCK INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>This Block is a practical block. It consisits of 5 sections, namely, HTML, Advanced HTML, VBScript, JavaScript, and Dreamweaver. Each section introduces the basics of scripting language, how to create teh basic documents and finally a list of 10 sessions for doing practical exercises. The details of the commands of the scripting language are explained in the respective untis of Block 1 of this course.</p>
    <p>The block is organized as follows: section 1 describes HTML. It introduces the basics of HTML, how to create an HTML document, steps for creating an HTML program and finally, it contains 10 sessions for lab practice.</p>
    <p>Section 2 goes one step further and introduces Advanced HTML. All the lab exercises in this session are about the two basic advanced features: frames and forms. HTML deals with the forms exactly the same way as you would with a paper form. There are groups of items and single items all gathered together in one large form, like a paper form.</p>
    <p>Section 3 focuses on JavaScript, which is also a scripting language. The JavaScript provides interactivity to the user. The following features are supported in JavaScript:
        <ul>
            <li>Add scrolling or changing messages to the browser's status line.</li>
            <li>Validate the contens of a form and make calculations.</li>
            <li>Display messages to the user, either as part of a web page or in alert boxes.</li>
            <li>Animate images or create images that change when you move the mouse over them.</li>
            <li>Detect the browser in use and display different contents for differnt browsers.</li>
            <li>Detect installed plugins and notify the user if a plugin is required.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>This section also gives tips on how to incorportate JavaScript into a Web Page.</p>
    <p>Section 4 introduces VBScript. Like JavaScript, VBScript is a powerful and easy to learn tool that can be used to provide interactivity to the Web page. As in the previous section, we also discuss how to incorporate VBScript into HTML pages.</p>
    <p>Section 5 is the last section and introduces Dreamweaver, which works like an HTML editor. Before providing lab sessions, we provide the following descriptions about the package:
        <ul>
            <li>How to work in Dreamweaver</li>
            <li>Insert external media in the webpages</li>
            <li>Adding SSI to the page</li>
            <li>Adding CSS style to the page</li>
        </ul>
