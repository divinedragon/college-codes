    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>Markup is information that is added to a document to convey information about the document's structure or presentation. Markup languages are all around us in everyday computing. While you may not see it, word processing documents are filled with codes indicating the structure and presentation of the document. What you see on your screen just looks like a page of text, but the formatting is done "behind the scenes" by the markup. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and its successor, XHTML, are the not-so-behind-the-scenes markup languages that are used to tell Web browsers how to structure and, some may say, display Web pages.</p>
